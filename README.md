Hello!

This is a first small project from a series of more to come, or maybe they are already up when you read this, who knows?

First iteration of this is just a concept, as all the functionality of the app are working but there is room to improve with things such as adding a data base in order to store the previous notes before closing the app and an edit button in order to modify a note, if necessary.
